I'd avoid automapper and mediator libs cause its going commercial soon.
Change id of tables from guid to id to save database space.
I'd not use the request and response model and receive a command or query in my controller to avoid code duplication.
    by removing it you also reduce code done inside controller 
    also a little boost in performance because it has less automapper calls



implement logger
